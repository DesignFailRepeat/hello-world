# hello-world
Over time my programming interests have evolved. My programming journey started with MATLAB. I started learning python on the side of my primary career, and have sparked an interest in full stack web development.

I'm a mechanical engineer by training with background in propulsion, stratospheric ballooning, and satellite thermal & structural design. Through my years in the space science and engineering field, I've come to the conclusion that satellite design can be a slow and sometimes painstaking process. The paperwork alone can become repetative and lacks excitement. My goal is to improve my programming skills to develop tools used to improve and automate the fabrication of complex satellite instruments. The goal is to create these sets of tools that work intuitively together, with a stimulating and automated experience. 

This is going to be a rewarding experience, and I am very excited to be a part of this community.
